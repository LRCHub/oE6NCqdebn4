Put your head on my shoulder
Hold me in your arms
Baby, squeeze me, oh, so tight
Show me that you love me too

Put your lips next to mine, dear
Won't you kiss me once, baby?
Just a kiss goodnight, maybe
You and I will fall in love

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, tell me that you love me too
(You love me too)

Put your head on my shoulder say you love me
Love me too

People say that love's a game
A game you just can't win
If there's a way
I'll find it someday
And then this fool will rush in
(Then this fool will rush in)

Put your head on my shoulder
Whisper in my ear, baby
Words I want to hear
Tell me, tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too

Put your head on my shoulder (put your head on my shoulder)
Tell me you love me
I love you
Oh, kiss me one more time (tell me you love me)

(Tell me you need me)
(Tell me you want me) All the time
All the time, oh oh
(Tell me you love me)
Put your head on my shoulder (tell me you need me)
Tell me you're mine (tell me you want me)

(Tell me you want me) Whisper the words I want to hear
(Tell me you need me) I'll whisper in your ear
I love you, my dear

(Tell me you love me) I love the time
(Tell me you need me)
(Tell me you want me)
Whisper the words I wanna hear

No other face could take you off my mind
You're so refined
You're much to kind
I have to warn you I'm never gonna set you free
Cos I was born to love you for eternity

Whenever you're away from me
Wherever you go
You're never far away from me
I want you to know
I only have to close my eyes dear
And suddenly I'm where you are
You'd better never stray
Cos I'll never be far away

On every breeze I seem to hear your name
My hearts aflame
I feel the same
I'd fall apart dear
If you let the feelin' end
Don't break a heart dear
Nobody else could mend

Whenever you're away from me
Wherever you go
You're never far away from me
I want you to know
I only have to close my eyes dear
And suddenly I'm where you are
You'd better never stray
Cos I'll never be far away

Whenever you're away from me
Wherever you go
You're never far away from me
I want you to know
I only have to close my eyes dear
And suddenly I'm where you are
You'd better never stray
Cos I'll never be far away
You'd better never stray
Cos I'll never be far away

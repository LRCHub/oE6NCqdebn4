Love can't be love
If it's just for the moment
Only to pass the night away
As we both get nearer
Deeper love is so much clearer
Long as we do it face to face

And I have known
All the lost lonely people
My world has found a place in your smile
If you're searching for a different love than mine
You'll never stop me loving you

More love of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go but let each other know
If we never try then we never lie face to face

You make a man like a child with your power
Help me to find my way inside
Let me drink your potion
Let me drown in your emotion

Lover to lover, face to face

In time we learn from the lost lonely people
That love can last as long as time
There was never born another one for me
You'll never stop me loving you

More love of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
Loving you means to me
No letting go but let each other know
If we never try then we never lie
Face to face

I'll be with you when the world is lies and the music dies
Just as long as I know there will be
More love of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
Loving you means to me
No letting go but let each other know
If we never try then we never lie
Face to face
I'll be with you when the world is lies and the music dies
Just as long as I know there will be
More love of your love

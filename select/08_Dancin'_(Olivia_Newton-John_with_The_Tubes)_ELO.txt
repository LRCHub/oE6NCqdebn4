Anybody blue, anybody needin' someone too
Anyone feelin' cold, no one there, you can hold
Don't wait to get old and gray, I'm gonna blow all the clouds away
'Cos there is nothing I would rather do

Forget about the blues tonight, sweet thing
Forget about the rules tonight, sweet thing
I wanna dance with you, until the sun comes creepin' through
I wanna dance with you, I won't stop pleasin' you, ah...

Honey for awhile, give a girl a chance to show some style
If you got no love to spare, tell me lies, I don't care
You better believe that I, I know some moves that we've got to try
'Cos there is nothing I would rather do

Forget about the blues tonight, sweet thing
Forget about the rules tonight, sweet thing
I wanna dance with you, until the sun comes creepin' through
I wanna dance with you, I won't stop pleasin' you, Aahh

Lover I want to let you know, I won't take a back seat
Ain't willin' to let you go, I won't take a back seat
Don't wanna hear what you want, it's gotta be all my way
And I'm makin' sure you stay to see
I'm really a selfish man, I've gotta get right to it
And lover tonight I'm thinkin' of me

Lover I won't take a back seat tonight, oooh
Lover gettin' on my two feet tonight, oooh
Got some dancin' to do, got some dancin' to do
Got some dancin' to do, got some dancin' to do

Can't let anyone get to you, I won't take a back seat
Let me show you what I can do, I won't take a back seat
It ain't funny to fool with me, I'd be a sad loser
You're gettin' me mad using me
You tried puttin' a spell on me, 'cos I had a strange feelin'
You'd better get down to healin' me

Lover I won't take a back seat tonight, oooh
Lover gettin' on my two feet tonight, oooh
Got some dancin' to do, got some dancin' to do

Aahh

Forget about the blues tonight,
Sweet thing(Lover I won't take a back seat tonight, oooh)
Forget about the rules tonight,
Sweet thing(Lover I won't take a back seat tonight, oooh)
I wanna dance with you,
Until the sun comes creepin' through(Got
Some dancin' to do, got some dancin' to do)
I wanna dance with you,

(Got some dancin' to do, got some dancin' to do)
Forget about the blues tonight,
Sweet thing(Lover I won't take a back seat tonight, oooh)

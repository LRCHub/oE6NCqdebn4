(She walks in)
(And I'm suddenly a hero)
(I'm taken in)
(My hopes begin to rise)

Look at me
Can't you tell I'd be
So thrilled to see
The message in your eyes? (You make it seem)
(I'm so close to my dream)
(And then suddenly it's all there)

Suddenly, the wheels are in motion
And I - I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I - I'm ready to take all my chances with you

(And how can I)
(Feel you're all that matters?)
(I'd rely)
(On anything you say!)

I take care
That no illusions shatter
If you dare
To say what you should say (You make it seem)
(I'm so close to my dream)
(And then suddenly it's all there)

Suddenly, the wheels are in motion
And I - I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I - I'm ready to take all my chances with you

(Why do I feel)
(So alive when you're near?)
(There's no way any hurt can get through)
Longing to spend every moment of the day with you - with you

Suddenly, the wheels are in motion
And I - I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly, I don't need the answers
'Cause I - I'm ready to take all my chances with you!
